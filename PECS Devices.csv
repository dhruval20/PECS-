Heating Cushions,"Heated cushions are portable or integrated seat accessories that contain built-in heating elements. They serve as an alternative to fully integrated heated chairs, offering targeted warmth by elevating the temperature at the contact surface between the occupant and the seat.",Heating,Conduction,Building Detached
Heating chair and leg warmer,Detached conductive heat transfer device + Wearable PECS,Heating,Conduction,Building Detached
Heating radiators,"Radiative heating radiators are devices that emit heat primarily through infrared radiation. They warm occupants and objects by directly radiating thermal energy, rather than heating the air via convection.",Heating,Radiation,Building Detached
Heating and Ventilation PECS,PECS that delivers heating with ventilation,Heating + Ventilation,,
Heating blowers,"These devices use hot-air blowers that combine two modes of heat transfer. They not only warm the air (convective heat transfer) but also emit thermal radiation, thereby providing a dual mechanism to deliver heat to the occupant’s environment.",Heating,Radiation + Convection,Building Detached
Heating and Cooling Clothing,"Hybrid Cooling Clothing refers to garments that use a combination of cooling and/or heating and/or ventilation technologies to regulate body temperature and enhance comfort. These garments may integrate passive or active cooling methods, such as air ventilation, phase change materials, or thermoelectric systems etc.",Dual Thermal Management,,Wearable
Cooling Jacket (Liquid cooled),"Liquid-Cooled Clothing refers to garments that use a circulating liquid system to regulate body temperature by absorbing and dissipating heat. These garments typically contain a network of tubes or channels through which a cooling liquid (such as water or a coolant mixture) flows, removing excess heat from the body. The liquid is often cooled externally using a heat exchanger, refrigeration unit, or ice pack.",Cooling,Conduction,Wearable
Heating radiator,Detached conductive and radiative heat transfer heating device,heating,Conduction + Radiation,Building Detached
Cooling blowers,"Such devices primarily rely on convection to deliver cool air. They work by circulating ambient or cooled air to remove excess heat from the occupant’s immediate environment, thereby relying on natural or forced convective currents without active refrigeration.",cooling,convection,building detached

Heating and cooling jacket (PCM),"PCM Vest refers to a temperature-regulating garment that incorporates phase change materials to provide passive thermal management. These vests absorb, store, and release heat to help maintain wearer comfort in varying environmental conditions. PCM vests are commonly used in industries with extreme temperatures, outdoor work environments, and medical applications to improve thermal stability and reduce heat stress.",Dual Thermal Management,Convection + Evaporation,Wearable
Cooling Clothing,"Personal Cooling Clothing refers to garments designed to regulate body temperature by enhancing heat dissipation and reducing thermal strain on the wearer. These garments use passive or active cooling technologies such as air ventilation, liquid cooling, phase change materials, or evaporative cooling.",cooling,,wearable
Personal heating and cooling system,This is an integrated system that offers both heating and cooling functions in a single device or setup. It can dynamically switch between modes or operate in a combined manner to adjust the thermal environment around an individual based on current needs.,Dual Thermal Management,,
Radiant cooling desk,Detached radiative heat transfer cooling device,cooling,radiation,Building Detached
Cooling and ventilation headrest,"Seat Headrest Personalized Ventilation (SHPV) refers to an air supply system integrated into the headrests of seats, designed to deliver clean, conditioned air directly to the breathing zone of an occupant. This system enhances thermal comfort and air quality by allowing precise control over the airflow's characteristics, such as temperature, rate, and direction, tailored specifically to an individual's preferences and environmental conditions",Cooling + Ventilation,Conduction + Convection,Building Detached
thermally activated building system,"Thermally Activated Building System (TABS) refers to an innovative method of using a building's thermal mass (such as concrete slabs or ceilings) to regulate the indoor temperature. By embedding hydronic (water-based) pipes within the building structure, TABS uses the building itself as a radiant heating and cooling system. The system circulates warm or cool water through the pipes, enabling the building's structure to absorb or release heat",Dual Thermal Management,radiation,Building Attached
Cooling chair (Thermoelectric),"A type of cooled chair that uses thermoelectric (Peltier) modules to actively remove heat from the seat surface, thus providing a cooling effect for improved thermal comfort.",Cooling,conduction,Building Detached
Under floor air distribution,"Type of background ventilation system - Uses an underfloor supply plenum located between the structural slab and the underside of a raised floor system to deliver conditioned air to floor supply outlets. Supply air enters the occupied space through the floor diffusers, which, although in some cases have fixed openings, are most commonly adjustable by nearby occupants",ventilation,outdoor air supply,building attached
Cooling and heating underdesk air terminal,An under-desk air terminal device is a localized air delivery unit positioned beneath a desk that supplies conditioned air directly to the lower body region of an occupant,Dual Thermal Management,convection,Building Detached
Cooling clothing (water cooled),"Water-Cooled Clothing refers to garments that use a circulating water system to regulate body temperature by absorbing and dissipating heat. These garments typically contain a network of tubes or channels through which cold water flows, removing excess heat from the body.
